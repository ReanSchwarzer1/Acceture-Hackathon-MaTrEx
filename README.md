Poster selected for presentation at India's largest human-computer interaction conference.
Researched on the advantages and limitations of skill training in Virtual Reality.


[Idea]

We propose development of robust Virtual Reality training programs, offering a way for
skilled professionals to train the on-site technicians and to perform remote diagnostics over
VirtualReality, potentially in real time. To achieve this, we make use of digital twins - a virtual
model of a realmachine, so, the professionals can use the immersive effect to, for instance,
explode the twin model and either explain itâ€™s working or help pinpoint the cause of a
malfunction, allowing the professional to interact with and explain the working of the
machine, thus making it a form of Assisted Reality powered by Digital Twins. This will not
only provide training opportunities but also provide Ad-hoc maintenance opportunities, using
the real time data provided by Industrial Internet of Things (IIOT) devices.
